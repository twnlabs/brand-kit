# Versioning

- Follow SemVer: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0).
- MAJOR: visual identity change or breaking removals/renames.
- MINOR: new assets, non-breaking updates (additions).
- PATCH: small fixes (metadata, minor export corrections).

Stable filenames
- Keep filenames stable across patch/minor releases to avoid breaking links.
- If an asset must be renamed or removed, document in release notes and provide a deprecation window when possible.
